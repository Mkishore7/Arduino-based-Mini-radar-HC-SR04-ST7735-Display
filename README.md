# Arduino-based-Mini-radar-HC-SR04-ST7735-Display
I have made a Mini compact Radar with display for that I have used HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, this sensor emit ultrasonic sound which came back to sensor after reflecting from an object, all the data visualization is displayed on 1.8" ST7735 display, if any object detect by radar it'll show in display in red line.

I have prepared a custome made PCB and order it from JLCPCB.COM to get professional touch to my project
